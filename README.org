* Advent of code
My solutions to Advent of Code over the years. Generally I don't go for
leaderboard times since I value code quality over speed. I also tend to learn
languages through AoC, so speed would never work out anyway.

** 2019
My first year, I only managed 10 days of it. I will need to return to this one.
It was written in very poor python.

** 2020
Went back to this year (also in C++).

** 2021
My second AoC and first time ever using Rust.

** 2022
Third AoC, again in Rust because the previous year was so much fun.

** 2023
This year I decided to learn C++ for real. I had most issues with string
parsing, so I ended up making a nice string view library for doing most
of that work.

** 2024
First time using Zig. I'm a fan.
