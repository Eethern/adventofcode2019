This year is written in Rust!
- DAY 1 :: =BinaryHeap= is about the same speed as just sorting, but should scale better.
- DAY 2 :: =HashMap= to look up the answers, kind of feels like cheating since
  it hardcodes the rules of the universe.
- DAY 3 :: =HashSet= for to find common occurences in first task. =HashMap= to
  implement a counter for occurences across strings for second task.
- DAY 4 :: Bounds checking, not much to say. Originally though it
  would require checking across all combinations of pairs, not just
  within pairs.
- DAY 5 :: Regex to parse, =VecDeque= for each crate stack, and a =VecDeque=
  for part b.
