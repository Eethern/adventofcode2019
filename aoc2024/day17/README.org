Part1 is simply implementing the ISA.

Part2 required realizing that for the specific input program each loop iteration
checks an independent 3 bits of A. Thus in order to compute the quite value, we
can find all values 0..8 that produce each output.

One caviat is that there can be multiple quines and we need the smallest one, so
I keep track of them for the next stage with a stack. To avoid mutating the
stack I have two stacks the each output swap pointers to avoid extra
allocations.
