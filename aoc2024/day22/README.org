#+title: Monkey Market

For part1 we just iterate the hash functions.

Part2 requires us to find the best 4-sized window of differences that yields the
best price across all buyers. The simplest way to do this is to implement a
sliding window across the 2000 hash iterations.

Because we're looking for first time the window shows up, we maintain two
hashmaps:
1. local_scores: Each buyer has the first price of every window encountered
   during the 2000 steps.
2. global_scores: Each local_scores entry is aggregated into the global_scores
   so that given any window we can find the total number of bananas.

The global_scores entry with the largest prices is the best window to use, and
also contains the answer to part2.
