#+title: Disk Fragmenter

Kindof like a left and right pointer algorithm. Part1 maintains the size of
available space in each file and moves either full or partial files based on
these sizes.

Part2 simply loops over files from the right. For each file find the first
available chunk of space starting from the left and move it there.
