#+title: Hoof It

Part 1 tasks us with finding out how many end nodes we can reach from each start
node. This can easily be done with a DFS or BFS without ending condition. In
this case I chose running a DFS from each start node.

Part 2 requires finding all possible paths from a start node to any end
node. Dynamic programming can be used if we maintain the number of paths that
end in a specific node.
