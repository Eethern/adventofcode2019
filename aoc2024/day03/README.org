#+title: Mull It Over

Went crazy on this one. I've not used regex in zig so I build my own Lexer and
Parser. They are pretty cool but turned out to be a bit overkill for this
task. The parser takes the tokens provided by the lexer and evaluates sequences
of expressions.

For part2 just maintain a state whether multiplication is enabled and sum accordingly.
