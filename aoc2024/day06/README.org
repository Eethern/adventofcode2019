#+title: Guard Gallivant

For part1 simulate the guard and keep track of where it has moved using a visited grid.

For part2 switch to a hashmap and hash the position + direction into a
key. Then it's just checkpointing the guard every step, placing a wall in front
ot if, and checking if a loop occurs with the hashmap. Finally restore from
checkpoint and repeat until the guard has left the area.
