# Resonant Collinearity

Indexed each antenna into a HashMap(freq, ArrayList(coordinate)) so that
querying all antennas of a frequency is easy.

Given two antennas you can find all antipoles via vector algebra. For part2 just
repeat this step until the antipole is out of bounds of the grid.

Then use a HashSet(Vec2) to keep track of positions with antipoles and count the
size of the set at the end.
