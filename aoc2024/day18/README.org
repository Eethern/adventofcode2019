#+title: RAM Run

Part1 is just a repeat of a previous days' Dijkstra's, except the graph now
mutates over time. This means part of whether we are allowed to move depends on
how many steps we've already taken (i.e. dist).

I brute-forced part2 by repeating the search for each possible time, and
detecting whenever there no longer was a path from start to finish.
