Part1 can be solved by a running a flood fill algorithm on every cell (skip
already flooded cells for efficiency). This gives both the area and the
perimeter if we track it during the fill.

Part2 is a simple extension were while counting the area of the region, we also
count the number of corners. For these shapes the number of corners is the same
as the number of sides and can be more easily computed by considering inward
corners and outward corners separately.
